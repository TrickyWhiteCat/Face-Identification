# Face Identification with Metric Learning
*A Capstone Project for IT3320E - Introduction to Deep Learning at Ha Noi University of Science and Technology*

## Introduction
Face Recognition, situated at the intersection of computer vision and artificial intelligence, has transformed security, identity verification, and human-computer interaction. This paper delves into the key challenges of Face Recognition, with a primary focus on face detection and verification tasks. Models such as YOLOv5s, ADNet, MTCNN, SSD, VGG16, InceptionV2, and MobileNetV3 are strategically chosen to address specific challenges. The objective is to identify the most effective model or combination for each task, offering valuable insights into
the dynamic field of Face Recognition.
The project conducts a comprehensive evaluation of face detection (YOLOv5, MTCNN, SSD300) and verification models (InceptionNetV2, VGG16, MobileNetV3) using CELEBA and Labeled Face in the Wild datasets. YOLOv5 and MTCNN excel in detection, with YOLOv5 consistently performing well. MTCNN outperforms in face alignment. In verification, MobileNetV3 + ArcFace achieves the highest accuracy (95.93%) and true positive rate (86.43%) at a false positive rate of 0.1%. The findings emphasize the substantial impact of model architecture on face verification performance.
